# Source-To-HTML

ABSTRACT:

Given input code (in this project input given as C program) the convertor should make it into an HTML based output that can be read by a browser. In popular syntax highlighter based solutions / tools such mechanisms are internally used, thereby making code walkthrough easier. Reserved keywords, preprocessor directives, numerical constants, strings etc must be displayed in predefined color.

Applications:

Syntax highlighting is a feature of modern day text editors that are used for programming. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts as per the option set by the user. Modern day text editors which are often called as Integrated Development Environment (IDE) come with syntax highlighting as one of the important features. Some modern day IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++ implement them very well with so many other options.
